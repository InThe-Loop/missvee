We are entitled to refuse a return if the unwanted product is returned damaged, not in a re-saleable condition or missing any accessories. </p>
                <p><strong>Not what you ordered?</strong></p>
                <p>If we accidentally deliver the wrong product to you or if the product is not as described on the Website (or if it is missing any accessories), please notify us and we will collect the product from you at no charge. Once we have inspected the product and validated your return, we will, at your choice, deliver the correct product to you as soon as possible (if the correct product is available); or credit your account with the purchase price of the product within 14 days of the return.</p>
                <p><strong>Defective products</strong></p>

                <p>We do our best to ensure that the products we deliver to you are of a high quality and without defects. </p>

                <p>What is a defect? A defect is a material imperfection in the manufacture of a product or any characteristic of a product, which makes the product less acceptable than one would reasonably be entitled to expect in the circumstances. </p>

                <p>The following will NOT be regarded as defects and will not entitle you to a return under this agreement: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>faults resulting from normal wear and tear;</li>
                    <li>damage arising from negligence, user abuse or incorrect usage of the product;</li>
                    <li>damage arising from a failure to adequately care for the product;</li>
                    <li>damage arising from unauthorised alterations to the product; and</li>
                    <li>where the specifications of a product, although accurately described on the Website and generally fit for its intended purpose, do not suit you.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Charges</strong></p>
                <p>If you return a defective product to us, but you fail to return all of the accessories that were sold with that product, we are entitled (subject to applicable law) to refuse the return, only to replace the item that you did return, or to estimate the value of the missing accessories and only to credit or refund you in respect of the returned item.</p>

                <p>If you return a product that does not comply with this policy, you may be liable to reimburse <strong>MissVee</strong> Famous Look for the cost of collecting the product from you and the cost of having the product returned to you.</p>
